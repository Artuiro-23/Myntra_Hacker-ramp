# AI-Driven Recommendation System & Virtual Try-On Feature for Fast Fashion

## Problem Statement
The fast fashion industry faces challenges with low customer engagement and conversion rates, primarily due to the lack of personalized and relevant product recommendations. As a result, customers often find it difficult to discover products that match their preferences, leading to reduced satisfaction and lower sales. Additionally, this inefficiency contributes to waste in the supply chain, as unsold inventory accumulates.

## Solution Overview
We propose a two-fold solution to address these challenges:

1. **AI-Driven Recommendation Model**
2. **Avatar System for Virtual Try-Ons**

## A. AI-Driven Recommendation Model

### Data Mining
The system will gather data from multiple sources, including:
- **User Demographics**: Age, gender, location, etc.
- **Purchase History**: Previous purchases and browsing behavior.
- **Browsing Behavior**: Pages visited, time spent on each product, etc.
- **Fashion Trends**: Scraped from fashion websites and social media.
- **Product Information**: Descriptions, images, categories, etc.

Integrating these diverse data sources will build comprehensive user and product profiles, forming the foundation of the recommendation system.

### Model Training
The recommendation system will utilize three primary techniques:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Analyzes user-item interactions to identify patterns and preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Leverages product features, including text and images, to recommend similar items.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combines both approaches to enhance recommendation accuracy and relevance.

### Clustering
- **Demographic Clustering**: Groups users based on demographics to provide personalized recommendations.
- **Trend Clustering**: Groups products based on Gen Z fashion insights and popular trends.

These clustering techniques will tailor recommendations to specific user segments and ensure the system stays updated with the latest fashion trends.

### Recommendation Engine
The engine will operate in two modes:
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Provides instant personalized product suggestions based on user interactions.
- **Batch Processing**: Periodically updates recommendation lists with the latest data.

## B. Create Avatar for Virtual Try-On

Create a personalized shopping experience with our virtual try-on feature. Users input their body measurements and preferences to generate a custom 3D avatar. They can then try on outfits virtually, seeing how clothes fit and look without having to physically try them on. Our solution combines AI-powered avatar creation, 3D rendering, and AR/VR integration to revolutionize the online shopping experience.
